      %h2 Partnering with Web Dev Camp
    %p.text-center
      Web Dev Camp is looking for partners to help in different aspects of running the school.
      Depending of the case and the partnering company this must be discussed in detail, but here
      we outline some of Web Dev Camp's general benefits for partnering companies.

      %h3 Teacher exchange
    %p.text-center
      Companies that have web or programming expertise may use Web Dev Camp as a training
      camp for their developers.
      %br
      Anyone who has ever taught can attest to the fact that you don't really know a subject until
      you have taught it. Only when we are bombarded with the strange question that only a beginner
      can have, and have to explain the subject not only in our own words, but in the words of the
      student, do we really make the step from thinking we know, to knowing.
      %br
      Companies who realize the benefit of this may partner with Web Dev Camp for a regular
      teacher exchange.

      %h3 Developer sourcing
    %p.text-center
      Web development is an area that grows so fast that there seems to be a constant need for
      developers. Many companies have difficulties recruiting as fast as they wish to grow.
      %br
      An ideal new employee could start being productive right away. But web development is
      not construction and so even experienced developers have to be brought up to speed, taught the
      companies unique stack of technical solutions.
      %br
      As an initial training seems inevitable companies have realized that younger developers can
      be useful for a variety of tasks. Since they have to be trained anyway, that main
      requirement is a basic set of knowledge. Web Dev Camp teaches exactly that set of basic skills
      so that graduates may become productive in basic tasks very quickly.
      %br
      Companies that have realizes the usefulness of this approach can partner with Web Dev Camp.

      %h3 Student participation
    %p.text-center
      Many companies need to have web development experience in house. The size and importance of
      web projects means that it is no longer viable to outsource the whole process.
      %br
      Any larger web application involves many decisions which affect a previously undervalued aspect,
      namely maintainability. Applications need to change with the times and long after the initial
      construction maintenance and improvements continue.
    %p.text-center
      The best way to handle all aspects of web application construction is by having the expertise
      in house. This may range from a single technical advisory position to building a small team
      that partakes in the initial construction and then performs maintenance.
      %br
      Often it can be easier to teach an existing domain expert the technical knowledge, than to
      teach an outside technical person the domain. In any case this results in a better balance
      for the company as it is left with more knowledge in house, vs having to spend time to teach
      an outsider only to have both that and the technical knowledge vanish after the project is
      completed.

      %h3 Project mockups
    %p.text-center
      Companies often create a mockup before embarking on the real project. This may be to establish
      either technical feasibility, usability, and more often also "just" requirement gathering.
      %br
      Doing web application mockups may be prohibitively expensive, especially for smaller companies
      or departments. Web Dev Students can create such mockups, especially in their final weeks.
      %br
      The approach may be especially constructive if a representative of the company is on the
      course, either as a teacher, or student.
