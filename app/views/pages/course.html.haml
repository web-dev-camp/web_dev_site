              Initial teaching happens in small groups where you will be able to ask questions immediately.
              You will be building useful apps for real people throughout the course.

                Basic box model
                %span.content
                  Boxes in boxes is a simple way to think about html. You'll learn a little about it's
                  initial shortcomings and current standards.
                  %br
                  We introduce
                  = link_to "Haml" , "http://haml.info/" , target: :blank
                  as a shorter, more concise and error free way of writing correct html.
                  %br
                  Also you'll learn about the type of boxes and how they can be arranged, in other
                  words the connection to css.
              %br
              %span.tipster
                %i.ico-color.ico-xxs.ico-rounded.ico-hover.fa.icon-css3
                Style basics
                %span.content
                  If we think of html elements as boxes, then we can think of css as labels on these
                  boxes. The label describes the box and importantly there is a finite number of
                  labels.
                  %br
                  This is the basic distinction between content and style. Over the course you will
                  learn more and more about the myriad of ways css can be used. Similar to Haml,
                  =link_to "Sass" , "http://sass-lang.com/" , target: :blank
                  is a shorthand and more semantic (but equivalent) way of writing css.
              %br
              %span.tipster
                %i.ico-color.ico-xxs.ico-rounded.ico-hover.fa.icon-file-code
                Object model
                %span.content
                  We are physical beings, and are well trained to think in terms of innate "things"
                  having given properties. In one of the easiest to understand ways of programming
                  we call the things object and their properties attributes.
                  %br
                  You will learn basic concepts of object oriented programming in Ruby, which is very
                  thorough in it's approach to treating everything as an object, and the concept of
                  class. We will see how procedural code (think cooking recipes) slot nicely into
                  this model as methods.
              %br

                Roles
                %span.content
                  Software development is all about teamwork. Even tools have got much better, so have timetables
                  shrunk. In any meaningful project we rely on other people's strengths to achieve a goal.
                  We will talk about the different roles and skills people have, not just to see
                  what a software developer is, but also to open the scope of possibilities for your
                  future career. People are best at what they enjoy and a large part of the course is
                  finding out what you are good at.
                  %br
                  Also projects are heavily dependent on often open source libraries, tools and
                  frameworks. The first of which are your os, editor, command-line and browser.
              %br

                Object table model
                %span.content
                  SQL databases are a ubiquitous, well understood and efficient way to store data. The
                  standard way of storing objects, maps classes to a tables and rows to objects.
                  %br
                  You will learn how this object table model is implemented in rails, or rather active
                  record and try out the tools that come with it. We also talk a little bit about
                  alternatives.

                Testing as assurance
                %span.content
                  Testing has been more of a nice idea in software engineering for a long time, before
                  finally, and especially in the ruby community, becoming a reality.
                  %br
                  There really is no other way to know that the software we write does what we intend
                  it to do, as you will be able to experience yourself very quickly.
                  %br
                  You will learn different types of testing and we will touch on frameworks and test
                  integration.

                %span.content
                  Here you learn a little more about the DOM and and how it can be used to create
                  simple dynamic pages, eg endless scrolling.
                  %br
                  We use existing tools and server side responses to generate html on the client.

                Semantic css / susy
                %span.content
                  Reviewing bootstrap html code we will see that it does not adhere to the content/style
                  separation we learned. To do it right, we introduce the concept of semantic css. This
                  gives meaningful names to our styles and lets them build ourselves.
                  %br
                  You'll earn
                  =link_to  "Susy" , "http://susy.oddbird.net/" , target: :blank
                  and how to build your own grid system.

                Concurrency and closures
                %span.content
                  Concurrency, several or even many things happening at the same time, has been a
                  difficult topic up to quite recently. You will learn better concurrency models like
                  the actor model and channels. Especially actors are easy to understand and reason
                  about since they just extend the object model to "active" objects.
                  %br
                  When a piece of code is passed of to another part of the program to be executed later,
                  one talk of closures, and we will see the somewhat different light this shed on
                  variable lifetime.

                %span.content
                  After having gained some hands on experience, you will understand the problems better
                  and so we will go into more advanced usage of git.
                  %br
                  This will give you a glimpse into how large project are run, both in the open source
                  world and in companies. After the theory you may choose to deepen this part or not,
                  since in larger projects this is usually a separate role.

                Searching
                %span.content
                  Going deeper into how to find objects in the database we learn about scopes, some
                  simple sql clauses and how to actually use sql in queries.
                  %br
                  You will learn the tools to build complex search interfaces and use pagination
                  on the results.

                Continuous testing
                %span.content
                  The next step will be to integrate our test fully into our workflow. This simply means
                  that no work should be accepted before adequate test are written and fixing bugs
                  should always start by writing test.
                  %br
                  To make the should a reality we make testing automatic both for the developer, and
                  for the current state of the committed source (in git). We will see the tools needed
                  to alert us directly of any shortcomings.

              Dom, the api for Html
              %span.content
                The Document Object Model (
                =link_to "DOM", "http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_htmldom.asp" , target: :blank
                ) gives us a programmatic interface to the rendered
                content. While html describes the static structure and a transport mechanism, the dom
                gives us a way to programmatically create, update and delete arbitrary nodes.
                %br
                This is the foundation for the modern web and client side applications.

              Bootstrap / Frameworks
              %span.content
                As in other language, css has libraries and frameworks that we can reuse. A modern
                framework like Bootstrap or Foundation will not only make the basic html "look good".
                %br
                You will also learn about standard elements, eg modern navigation, menus, dropdowns,
                callouts, buttons and many more. you'll see how a grid system works and how eg
                bootstrap solves the multi-device issue.

              Associations and structures
              %span.content
                Objects are great at modeling single entities, but in programs we need to model large
                system, invariably containing many objects.
                %br
                You will learn about different data structures and their different properties. Like
                how they are accessed, how they store data and which are good for what purpose.
                %br
                We will theoretically brush on O(n) and practically experiment with access and
                iteration.

              Git basics
              %span.content
                The sharing of code has always been very important but never as easy and efficient as
                today, with git. Even more, online sharing sites like
                =link_to "github.com", "https://github.com" , target: :blank
                fuel open source community by sharing publicly and across projects.
                %br
                You'll learn the basic workflow and will practice this in your own projects.

              %span.content
                In the same way we need structures for programming, we need associations in databases.
                You'll learn how associations are implemented and how they relate to the structures
                we have learned in the programming sessions.
                %br
                We see how associations are implemented as in rails by using metaprogramming
                techniques to create a very intuitive api.

                In the second module we will concentrate on exploring and using RSpec, a commonly
                used testing framework. We will be writing different tests and use supporting tools
                for creating mock object, managing database "cleanliness" and interacting with the
                application as if our test were a user.

              Client side applications
              %span.content
                Going further into client side api's and cross compilation we examine languages
                that can be used instead of using JavaScript directly, specifically
                =link_to "coffee script" , "http://coffeescript.org/" , target: :blank
                and
                =link_to "opal" , "http://opalrb.org/" , target: :blank
                %br
                We will look at evolving tools to write client side applications, like
                =link_to "volt" , "http://voltframework.com" , target: :blank
                ,
                =link_to "clearwater" , "https://github.com/clearwater-rb/clearwater" , target: :blank
                and
                =link_to "webix" , "http://opalphaser.com/" , target: :blank
                You will also have an opportunity to look at pure JavaScript frameworks like
                Angular, Ember, and Backbone.

              Mobile first, breakpoints
              %span.content
                While learning about Bootstrap, we touched on the multi-device concept and now go
                deeper into mobile first development. You'll learn what
                =link_to  "Breakpoints" , "http://breakpoint-sass.com/" , target: :blank
                are and how to implement one design that can be viewed on multiple devices.

              Other languages
              %span.content
                Ruby is off course just one of many languages and since by the seventh week you will
                have learned enough about it, we can start comparing it to other languages. Some of
                which are similar, some strange, some very different.
                %br
                Off course we will also cover JavaScript basics and ways to avoid some of JavaScripts
                strangeness by using languages that compile to JavaScript.
                %br
                You may also choose to learn a completely different language at this point, eg
                = link_to  "Go" , "https://golang.org/" , target: :blank
            %br

              Communication skills
              %span.content
                Off course code is by far not the only way developers communicate and so we will
                go into the importance of both communicating precisely both in documentation
                and presentation.
                %br
                We will practice both areas and learn some modeling visualization on the way.
                %br
                Also we debunk the common misconception that open source means that ownership is
                not important. This is especially important when wanting to collaborate in open
                source projects, which you have a chance to.

              Performance, NoSql
              %span.content
                We briefly look at database and application performance. The ways to scale, optimize
                and benchmark. This is an advanced topic, but you will learn to understand the issues.
                %br
                Finally we will explore the alternatives a little, so called NoSql, the concept of
                graph, object or document databases and possible uses.

              Client side testing
              %span.content
                Client side testing, like client side applications, is still quite young. But progress
                has been made and especially with the ruby tools we will see how.
                %br
                At the same time we will go into more depth on testing JavaScript enhanced web sites
                like the ones we will be building in this last module of the course.
